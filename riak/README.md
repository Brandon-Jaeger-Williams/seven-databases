# Builds

Dev tools, which are automatically installed by the vagrant build

https://github.com/basho/riak-client-tools/tree/master/devrel

A development cluster is automatically built for you, with five nodes. To check, test etc, follow the instructions below:

### Check installation of cluster
```
$ cd Projects/basho/riak/dev
$ ls
```
You should see dev1, dev2 etc

### Start
```
$ dev1/bin/riak start
```
â€¦. or
```
$ for node in dev*; do sudo $node/bin/riak start; done
```

### Check
```
$ ps aux | grep beam
$ for node in dev*; do sudo $node/bin/riak ping; done
```

### Create cluster
```
$ for n in {2..5}; do sudo dev$n/bin/riak-admin cluster join dev1@0.0.0.0; done
$ sudo dev1/bin/riak-admin cluster plan
$ sudo dev2/bin/riak-admin cluster commit
```

### Testing the cluster

See section below on access from outside the virtual machine for testing using Postman 
```
$ sudo dev1/bin/riak-admin member-status
$ sudo dev1/bin/riak-admin cluster status
$ curl -XPUT http://localhost:10018/buckets/welcome/keys/german -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -d 'herzlich willkommen'
```

Your HTTP port might differ, so check your configuration files for the valid port in your cluster. That information can be found in /etc/riak.conf if you're using the newer configuration system or in /etc/app.config if you're using the older system. (Look for listener.http.internal = 0.0.0.0:10018)
```
$ curl http://localhost:10018/buckets/welcome/keys/german
```

## Notes when going through book:
 * Remember to run every command with sudo. e.g "dev1/bin/riak start" will not work. "sudo dev1/bin/riak start" will work.
 * dev/dev2/bin/riak-admin join ... has been deprecated from this version of riak. Please refer to the notes above on how to create and test a cluster.
 * The book refers to dev/dev1/etc/app.config which is deprecated. It is now dev/dev1/etc/riak.conf.
 * The polly.jpg image has been placed in Projects/basho/riak.
 * The hotel.rb script has been placed in Projects/basho/riak as well. Note the script has not been executed.
 * The validators script has been placed in Projects/basho/riak/js_source. Note that the method mentioned in the book regarding including custom js files is deprecated. A new file called advanced.config has been created and placed in dev/dev1/etc for the respective nodes.

## Access outside virtual machine

Each riak node is configured to run on 0.0.0.0:port, where the port is defined by riak.conf in each dev1...dev5 directory. The sed command below is run by chef to make the nodes accessible from outside the VM, provided the port for the node has been forwarded by the Vagrant config.

```
cd ~/Projects/basho/riak/dev
for node in dev*; do sudo sed -i.bak s/127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0/g $node/etc/riak.conf; done
```
When running "vagrant up", pay special attention to the ports that are forwarded from your host system to the virtual machine. If you are having trouble connecting to a particular node, ensure the node is accessible on the correct port inside the VM, and that the VM port is forwarded from the expected port on the host system.

With the cluster accessible from outside the virtual machine, using Postman as an http client makes testing easy. 
[Install Postman from here](https://www.getpostman.com/) to get started.

From your host machine, do the following to check if it works from any http client: 
```
http://localhost:10018/ping 
```

For the brave, you can get the server stats by using this:
```
curl -s http://localhost:10018/stats | python -mjson.tool
```

# General instructions

Updated hotel.rb to fix Riak version change issues. You may need to adjust the port number.

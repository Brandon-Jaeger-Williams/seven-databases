# seven-databases - Postgress

Instructions:
1. Download and install PostGres 9.5.3.1 (avoid beta version)
    •	Setup admin password that you can remember for SuperUser

2. Download pgadmin3-1.22.1 (GUI program to interact with SQL)
    •	PGAdmin is the UI that connects to the postGresSQL database created during setup
    •	Take note of the username/password for the database superuser
    •	Use default Port number = 5432

3.  Navigate to PSQL console under the Plugins tab to execute commands and run through the exercises
    •	Take note that the commands are case sensitive

4.  Online docs are found here
    •	https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/index.html

Note from Mike regarding previous setup:

    To load extensions 'create extension …..' from shell works fine

(which will make sense when you get to it)
